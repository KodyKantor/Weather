A Python program to extract relevant weather data from NOAA archives

This is my first REAL python program. It is for a research project that I am working on
through the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN. The graduate engineering school is working on a project
for precision agriculture, for which they need weather data. My first job was to make this: a file of
the weather between March 15 - April 20th.

The MunicipalTextData.txt file is the file that has all of the raw data in it. The data is sorted into different
categories, which are listed at the top. Although the data is sorted, the layout is variable. For example,
there could be three white spaces between the first and second column, but five white spaces between the second and third.
The columns aren't aligned by tab stops, and columns that hold data aren't a fixed length. The variable column length can
be seen in the 'CLG' and 'VSB columns.
