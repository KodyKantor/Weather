A Python program to extract relevant weather data from NOAA archives

This is my first REAL python program. It is for a research project that I am working on
through the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN. The graduate engineering school is working on a project
for precision agriculture, for which they need weather data. My first job was to make this: a file of
the weather between March 15 - April 20th.
